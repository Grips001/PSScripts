This script creates a form that allows the user to get the top 5 processes consuming either memory or cpu on a remote machine.

To use

-Enter the name of the remote machine. If DNS cannot resolve without fqdn then enter the fqdn. IP works here too.
-Click either mem or cpu
-Once the name text field clears, paste into any text box that accepts paste to list the results. (ie notepad, text field on webpage etc)
-The original purpose for this app was to quickly paste into a support ticket the values needed so visually displaying the results was never needed.
