Closes all bloat processes that Adobe forces on users even after CC software is exited.

To use:

In the properties of the included shortcut "Powershell(Admin)" edit the target line:
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -f C:\insertpathhere\Fuck-Adobe\FuckAdobe.ps1
Replace "insertpathhere" with the path to where ever you save the folder.

Double-click the shortcut.

(The reason for this is the scritp must be run in an elevated powershell session due to Adobe being a load of cucks)
